## About

This project is a system developed with the ReactJS library that shows the list of characters from Marvel Comics with data provided by the API "Marvel API". In addition to displaying the complete list of characters, in the navigation bar there is an entry field and button for the user to search for a specific character by name. In addition to this, if the user clicks on details link, it goes to a specific page showing more information of a charater as well as the list comic book where we can find it.

Among the technologies used in this project are the Next.JS framework, Context API, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS with Tailwind Styled-Components, the Axios library to consume the Rest API.
